# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**meal-planner** - A meal planning application (architecture and implementation details to be added as the project develops).

## Development Commands

This is a fresh computer. If a task requires dependencies that are not yet installed, wait until I install them. Do not try to install yourself. Examples are node, git, python, and helpful CLI tools like gh.

*To be added once build tooling is configured*

## Architecture

*To be documented as the codebase structure is established*

## Git Workflow

- Feature branches follow the pattern: `claude/claude-md-documentation-W0wOc`
- Always develop on designated feature branches
- Use descriptive commit messages
